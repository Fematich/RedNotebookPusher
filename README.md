RedNotebookPusher
=================

Reads Rednotebook entries (multiple entries per day) and pushes them to Evernote

TODO
=================
currently only checks the entries from yesterday and pushes these to evernote
idea is to keep a local version so that all notes can be updated (full Evernote API needed to change notes)
